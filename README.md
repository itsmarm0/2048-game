# Game Description
2048 is a fun and addictive puzzle game where the goal is simple: slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create the tile 2048.

# How It Works::
Use arrow keys (or swipe gestures on mobile) to move tiles.

When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.

Each move spawns a new tileâ€”usually a 2 or 4.

The game ends when no more moves are possible.
