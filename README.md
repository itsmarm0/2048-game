# Game Description
2048 is a fun puzzle game where the goal is simple: slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create the tile 2048.

# How It Works::
Use arrow keys to move tiles.
When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.
Each move spawns a new tile(usually a 2 or 4).
The game ends when no more moves are possible.
